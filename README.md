# Global-Coups
A brief look through the number of successful coups, failed coups and deaths from coup attempts since 1945 to 2019

The data was obtained from the Illinois Data Bank.
 Peyton, Buddy; Bajjalieh, Joseph; Shalmon, Dan; Martin, Michael; Bonaguro, Jonathan (2021): Cline Center Coup D’état Project Dataset. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. https://doi.org/10.13012/B2IDB-9651987_V3
 
 I  basically created a separate table in the database specifically to group the fields listed above into countries, then pushed them into Power BI to create the visualizations.
 
 I would continue making more visualizations on this dataset..
 
 Thanks for viewing!
